# SteamDashboard
A dashboard analysing video games featured on the Steam store. Done to practice SQL querying and Tableau dashboarding.

I write about the process a bit on [my substack](https://marcohui.substack.com/p/how-i-create-interactive-dashboards)
Resulting dashboard can be viewed on [Tableau public](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/huimarco/viz/SteamStoreGames_16804223639880/Dashboard)
